                        <h3>Automation Testing</h3>
                        <p>Automation testing is the process of using specialized software tools to execute pre-defined tests on a software application automatically, without human intervention.
                        It helps in validating the functionality, performance, and reliability of an application by running repetitive test cases quickly and efficiently.
                        Automation testing is especially beneficial for large projects where frequent code changes occur, as it reduces manual effort, increases test coverage, and ensures consistent results.
                        Tools like Selenium, TestNG, and JUnit are commonly used in automation testing.
                        The key objective is to improve the overall software quality while speeding up the testing process and reducing the chances of human error.</p>
